# Understanding weather patterns with AccuWeather: An EIT Take Home Project

This project involves scraping weather data from AccuWeather, cleaning the data, visualizing the data and performing feature analysis to understand weather patterns in Baguio City from July 25, 2024 to September 7, 2024.

### Setup Instructions
1. Ensure that you have Python installed.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage Instructions
Open the Jupyter notebook `weather_data_analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells in order.

**WARNING:** Executing the code cells in the *Data Scraping from AccuWeather* section of `data_analysis.ipynb` will generate a new dataset as it scrapes the latest data available in the given link, which will be different from the one used for analysis in the next sections. Please only read the codes and markdowns in that section and do not execute them. Proceed to the Data Cleaning section after importing the modules to avoid changes in the dataset used for analysis.
